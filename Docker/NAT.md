Network Address Translation (NAT) is ==a technique that allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address==. It's often used on routers and firewalls

- It allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address.
- When a device inside the private network sends a request to the internet, the NAT replaces its private IP with the host’s public IP.
- When the response comes back, NAT forwards it to the correct internal device.
