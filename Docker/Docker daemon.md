The **Docker daemon** (often referred to as `dockerd`) is a background service that runs on your system and manages Docker containers. It's the core component of Docker that handles the creation, execution, and management of containers, images, networks, and volumes.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the Docker daemon does:

1. **Manages Containers**: It listens for Docker API requests (either from the Docker CLI or other clients) and creates or manages containers based on those requests.
    
2. **Builds and Runs Images**: The daemon is responsible for building Docker images (using `docker build`), pulling images from a registry (e.g., Docker Hub), and running containers from those images.
    
3. **Manages Networks**: It also manages Docker networks, allowing containers to communicate with each other and with the external world, setting up bridge networks or overlay networks, for instance.
    
4. **Handles Volumes**: The daemon handles Docker volumes, which are persistent storage used by containers.
    
5. **Exposes a REST API**: The Docker daemon exposes an API that allows communication with it. This API can be accessed directly or through the Docker CLI, which is essentially a client interface to the daemon.
    
6. **Manages Container Lifecycle**: It takes care of stopping, starting, and removing containers, along with their associated resources (such as networking and storage).
    

The Docker daemon typically runs as a background process on your system and can be controlled via the Docker CLI (`docker` commands). When you run a Docker command (like `docker run`, `docker ps`, etc.), the CLI sends requests to the daemon, which processes them and performs the corresponding actions.

By default, the Docker daemon runs as the root user, so it has sufficient privileges to perform actions on system resources like networking and storage.
