A firewall isÂ ==a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic==, acting as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, essentially filtering traffic based on predetermined security rules to prevent unauthorized access to a system.

- It blocks **unauthorized [[Inbound connections]]** from the internet, preventing direct access to private network devices.
- Typically, it only allows **[[Outbound connections]]** from the private network unless specific rules are set to allow inbound traffic.
