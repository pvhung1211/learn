Traffic going **out** from your network

- When a device inside your private network **initiates** a connection to an external network (e.g., the internet).
- Example:
    - You open your browser and visit `example.com`.
    - Your request goes **out** from your device to the website's server.
    - The server responds, and your browser loads the page.
    - This is an **outbound connection** from your device to `example.com`.
