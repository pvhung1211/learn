##### Image
- Like a recipe or blueprint
- Read-only template
- Can create many containers from one image
- Think of it as a "Class" in programming
- Stored in registries (like Docker Hub)

##### Docker Container
- Running instance of an image
- Like a dish made from a recipe
- Active, running application
- Think of it as an "Object" in programming
- Can be started, stopped, deleted

##### Analogy:
- Image = Cake Recipe
- Container = Actual Cake you baked
