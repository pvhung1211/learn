Traffic coming **in** to your network

- When an external device **initiates** a connection to a device inside your private network.
- Example:
    - A remote user tries to **SSH** into a server on your network.
    - A hacker tries to access your home router from the internet.
    - If there's no rule allowing the connection, a **NAT firewall** will block it.
